Features in this animation:

1. Multiple classes used to create multiple shape objects that comprise the scene and car parts
2. Data encapusaltiom in the form of private class fields with getters and setters, used to 
retrieve and print the initial xCoord of the car body and, then set a new xCoord and print that value.
Getters are also used to retrieve and car Body coordinates and used in the move methods for the wheel and roof objects.
3. Key events used to control the car's vertical position.
4. A bespoke method to move the car parts (shape objects) in unison while maintaining relative positioning.
5. Use of object data array to create, store and display the road line objects. 
6. Bespoke methods to animate the road lines to give the impression of movement.
7. Use of message dialog boxes to give instructions on start up.
8. Use of string methods and mesage dialog boxes to read text, diaplay it and scroll it on screen.

Room for improvement - Scale the objects that the car is composed of using the objects width/height/diameters relative to
the y axis.

Implement some road obstacles with some sort of collision detection for a more interactive experience
