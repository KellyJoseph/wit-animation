# wit-animation
Animation assignment for programming fundamentals module using JAVA and processing
A simple animation. This was my first assignment for my introduction to programming
course. It's a simple animation of a car designed to show implentation of classes and
objects. Having only worked with simple geometric shapes and colours, I decided to
make it a car, nice and boxy!
